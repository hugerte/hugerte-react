The HugeRTE React component 1.0.0 is based on the TinyMCE React component 6.0.0-rc. Unreleased changes from Tiny since 5.1.0 are included in the 1.0.0 changelog.

## 2.0.1 - 2025-06-30

## Fixed
- Building a project using `@hugerte/hugerte-react` failed without manually adding `@hugerte/framework-integration-shared` as a dependency.

## 2.0.0 - 2025-06-30

### Removed

- The onEditorChange callback was called three times when content was inserted with insertContent editor API. (Not sure if this bug did exist in 1.x, but anyway tests verify it's not present now.)
